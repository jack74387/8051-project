## LED Blinker

### Description

This project demonstrates a simple LED blinking program for the 8051 microcontroller using the SDCC (Small Device C Compiler).

The program toggles all pins of port P2 between 0xFF (all high) and 0x00 (all low) in an infinite loop, creating a blinking effect for LEDs connected to port P2.
